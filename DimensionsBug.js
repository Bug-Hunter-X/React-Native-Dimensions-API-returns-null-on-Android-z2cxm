This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, particularly on Android.  The issue is that the `Dimensions` API returns the dimensions asynchronously.  If you try to access the dimensions immediately after importing the API, the values will be null or undefined, causing a runtime error.  This is because the dimensions are not yet available when the component mounts.
